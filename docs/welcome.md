Welcome to the documentation for Soft V products.

## Overview 
The most popular product of the Soft V company is robocadV.
robocadV is a cross-platform robot simulator with a built-in environment, robot and scenario designer.  

To work with virtual robots, libraries are used for various programming languages, such as Python, Java, LabVIEW, C#, C++ and others.
If at the time of reading this you have not found libraries for your favorite programming language, do not worry, you can write your own library simply by looking at the internals of existing ones.  

But our company has not only robocadV, but also many other useful tools.
You can read more about each in specific chapters of the documentation.
