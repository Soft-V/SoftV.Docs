# Welcome to shufflecad

**shufflecad** is a desktop environment for the robot.
It allows you to run user programs, observe their lifecycle, and manage them as easily as moving pieces in a builder.
The application provides a visual control panel — variables become indicators and controls you can change on the fly for debugging.

**shufflecad** shows the robot's view of the world — camera streams and image processing results — letting you see what the robot "sees" and "understands". All actions, errors, and decisions are collected in a convenient logger, turning obscure messages into a clear execution history.

This is more than a tool: **shufflecad is the interface between the developer's ideas and the robot's behavior, enabling you to visualize, tune, and run the machine's intelligence.**
